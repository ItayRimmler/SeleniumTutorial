This small program is an attempt to learn Selenium.

What I wanted to do:
Randomly generate two songs with similar motifs (genre, mood...) and play them at the same time. That could've been a neat base program for
other experiments (like playing two songs with similar motifs and try to see how similar are they with ML tools, or playing the two songs 
and try to adjust them so they'll be in the same tempo).
Unfortunetly, FindElements did not work properly. So the script simply plays one song.

I learned it and did it in one day. So I think it's kinda cool.
